distinguished by two features: first, they are
activities that have to be undertaken regularly
in order to maintain the dwelling in good
working order; second, they do not change the
dwelling’s performance, capacity or expected
service life.
There are two types of maintenance and
repair of dwellings: those which are minor,
such as interior decoration and repairs to fittings, and which are commonly carried out by
both tenants and owners; and those which are
major, such as replastering walls or repairing
roofs, and which are carried out by owners
only.
Only expenditures which tenants and owneroccupiers incur on materials and services for
minor maintenance and repair are part of
individual consumption expenditure of households. Expenditures which owner-occupiers
incur on materials and services for major
maintenance and repair are not part of individual consumption expenditure of households.
Purchases of materials made by tenants or
owner-occupiers with the intention of undertaking the maintenance or repair themselves
should be shown under (04.3.1). If tenants or
owner-occupiers pay an enterprise to carry out
